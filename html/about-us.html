		<p>Hi my name is Jessica. I am a former competitive swimmer, provincial-team water polo player and reformed cardio queen. I have always had a great love 
		for fitness. As a former competitive swimmer I am used to using cross-training to get the best results out of my sport. I enjoy working out and make it a 
		priority to get some form of exercise in everyday. It helps me focus more and fidget less.</p>
		<p>I hope you enjoy this application. Should you have any questions feel free to contact me <a href="contact-us.html">here</a> or connect with me through 
		<a href="/">social media</a>. </p>
