##Differences
- 

##Clientele 
1. **Leslie Brafield** - mother and real estate mogule. 
- Leslie is a high-profile real estate agent in the Greater Toronto Area. While the real estate market continues to change and fluctuate to accomodate a changing demographic in home-buyers, the technology used to manage these has remained relatively stagnant.
- **Favourite past-times:** exercising and spending time with family.
- **Motivations:** spending more time at home, and less time worrying about getting documentation signed and into the office in a timely fashion (currently using a fax machine to achieve this purpose, which means that when the office closes, staff are not around to recieve the documentation). 
- **Demotivations:** not tech-savvy (just got her first Blackberry a year ago, when her Nokia circa 1998 finally gave out).

2. **Benjamin Somers** - 24 year old, legal intern in Montreal Quebec. 
- Benjamin is an intern at a legal firm in Montreal Quebec. He is a fairly tech savvy individual who enjoys using technology to make his life easier.
- **Favourite past-times:** waterpolo and having beers with friends.
- **Motivations:** as a legal intern, Ben has the responsibility of dealing with a lot of legal paperwork. He is bothered by the lengthy wait times for sign-offs on the paperwork as well as the poor-turnaround times.
- **Demotivations:** as an intern who is fairly tech-savvy picking up the technology shouldn't be a problem however, teaching "old-school" lawyers how to use new technology could present as a demotivating factor.
