#Sweaty Betty
Sweaty Betty is a fitness application designed to help the user create, track and change up their workouts to meet their fitness goals.
The premise of the application is simple, users create a profile tracking their progress as well as their fitness goals and the application develops a workout to match the needs of the user.
This application creates workouts for both the gym environment as well as the home environment, taking into consideration the limitations to an abundance of workout materials.
It also takes into consideration the length of time a user has to work out to help meet the user's fitness goals. 
All workouts and updates are documented and recorded in the users profile to help the user track their progress.  

##Features 
- A profile page that can be continually updated to help track the progress of the user;
- A repository of workouts;
- A custom created workout to match the workout environment as well as the time constraints of the user;

##Learning Goals
- To learn how to effectively develop a web application with a mobile friendly layout;
- To explore how to work with databases and repositories to store workouts and user information;
- To learn more about security and password protection for the web;
- To learn more about retrieving information from databases as well as how to archive material;

##Technologies and Techniques 
- Mobile first and responsive web design;
- Use and understand public key infrastructure (PKI);
- Use and understand databases (specifically MySQL) to save, store and later retrieve the digital signature;
- Use and understand password security and protection methods (to be discussed in a few weeks in class :)) to retrieve user information;

##User Research
1. **Jessica Bredschneider (myself)** - former competitive swimmer, provincial-team water polo player and reformed cardio queen. 
	- I have always had a great love for fitness. As a former competitive swimmer I am used to using cross-training to get the best results out of my sport.
	- **Favourite past-times:** exercising, playing sports and being outdoors.
	- **Motivations:** I enjoy working out and make it a priority to get some form of exercise in everyday. It helps me focus more and fidget less. 
	- **Demotivations:** not a lot of time, need an option for both home workouts as well as the gym.

2. **Cardio Queens** - female and or male, 16-30 years old, committed to doing cardio for 75% or 1 hour or more during a workout session. 
	- Cardio queens are generally females who base the majority of their workout timeframe doing extensive amounts of cardio (i.e. running on a treadmill, elliptical trainer etc.).
	- While cardio is good, it is not the be-all end-all of a workout and generally uninformed cardio queens don't see the value in weight training or doing another cross-training activity to meet their fitness goals.
	- **Favourite past-times:** cardio.
	- **Motivations:** toning up and lose weight.
	- **Demotivations:** afraid to use the weight room.
