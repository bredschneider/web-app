#SignaSecure
SignaSecure is a signature repository for working professionals that allows documents to be signed off in a secure and timely fashion.  
With this app, gone are the days where work would slow down to a stand still, while individuals wait for documents to be approved. 
With SignaSecure, documents can be signed off immediately via the web.

##Features 
- A one-time signature is captured using **Thomas J Bradley Signature Pad** *(http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/)* and stored in a repository for future use;
- Each signature is password protected (with multiple levels of security) to avoid the ease of accessing and forging signatures on legal documents;
- The signature can be added to a document using the password;

##Learning Goals
- To learn how to effectively develop a web application with a mobile friendly layout;
- To explore how to work with and integrate software to develop applications;
- To learn more about security and password protection for the web;

##Technologies and Techniques 
- Mobile first and responsive web design;
- Use and understand public key infrastructure (PKI);
- Use and understand plug-ins to create the digital version of signatures (specifically Thomas J Bradley Signature Pad);
- Use and understand databases (specifically MySQL) to save, store and later retrieve the digital signature;
- Use and understand password security and protection methods (to be discussed in a few weeks in class :)) to eliminate signature forgery and retrieve said signatures;

##User Research
This application will be used in a professional setting.
1. **Leslie Brafield** - mother and real estate mogul. 
	- Leslie is a high-profile real estate agent in the Greater Toronto Area. While the real estate market continues to change and fluctuate to accommodate a changing demographic in home-buyers, the technology used to manage these has remained relatively stagnant.
	- **Favourite past-times:** exercising and spending time with family.
	- **Motivations:** spending more time at home, and less time worrying about getting documentation signed and into the office in a timely fashion (currently using a fax machine to achieve this purpose, which means that when the office closes, staff are not around to recieve the documentation). 
	- **Demotivations:** not tech-savvy (just got her first Blackberry a year ago, when her Nokia circa 1998 finally gave out).

2. **Benjamin Somers** - 24 years old, legal intern in Montreal Quebec. 
	- Benjamin is an intern at a legal firm in Montreal Quebec. He is a fairly tech savvy individual who enjoys using technology to make his life easier.
	- **Favourite past-times:** waterpolo and having beers with friends.
	- **Motivations:** as a legal intern, Ben has the responsibility of dealing with a lot of legal paperwork. He is bothered by the lengthy wait times for sign-offs on the paperwork as well as the poor-turnaround times.
	- **Demotivations:** as an intern who is fairly tech-savvy picking up the technology shouldn't be a problem however, teaching "old-school" lawyers how to use new technology could present as a demotivating factor.
