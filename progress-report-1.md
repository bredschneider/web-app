#Progress Report 1

## July 9, 2012

1. In the past week, I have completed the login and registration page in php, as well as all of the html and css for all other pages.
2. I achieved my previous weeks' goals and had time to redesign the logo.
3. This week, I would like to complete the table for my workouts and get the php running for the workout page.
4. I re-learned how to do login and registration pages in php (which I had forgotten).
5. I enjoyed getting the login and registration pages working.
6. Getting the login and registration pages working was also the most frustrating part of last week.
7. No major changes so far.
