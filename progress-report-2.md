#Progress Report 2

## July 23, 2012

1. In the past week, I have completed the glossary and results page as well as completed the css for a mobile-first application.
2. I achieved my previous weeks' goals and had time to add in an area to call images (to be photographed at a later date).
3. This week, I would like to complete the photography and add their paths to the database.
4. I learned how to use arrays (which I also had forgotten).
5. I enjoyed getting the css and all pages working.
6. Getting the results and glossary pages to call the right elements was the most frustrating part of thie week.
7. No major changes so far.
